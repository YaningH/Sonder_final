        <h4>While we are often preoccupied with our own lives, sonder is the awareness that the person passing by, the stranger in line, or the friend you’re speaking to all carry experiences, emotions, and dreams as intricate and significant as your own. Their life is a rich, unfolding story, and you are but a brief character in it—just as they are in yours. <br><br> “I am a first-person protagonist in the small and specialized corner of reality that is my own life. In everyone else’s life, I’m an autonomous—and to some degree mysterious—visiting character.” <br><br> In life, you are the omnipresent Protagonist. The world is filtered through your perspective, shaped by your thoughts, emotions, and decisions. But beyond the edges of your reality, there are countless Other People, each the protagonist of their own unfolding story. Most remain bit players in your narrative, passing in and out of view. Yet, some become major characters, occupying significant space in your life. Still, no matter how close they feel, they always remain Other People. You never truly see inside their minds, nor can you dictate their choices. <br><br> Most of the time, no matter their role in your story, they exist offscreen—somewhere out there in the world, living a life as vivid and intricate as your own.
